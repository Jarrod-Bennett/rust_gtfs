//! Simple GTFS server for an embedded departure board system.
//!
//! This program acts as a hub, allowing multiple systems to request gtfs information to display. (todo! async/thread based based system)
//! The server accepts a request from the remote device, specifying the gtfs data required, such as
//! (in the case of a departure board) stop(s) to be displayed, the (maximum) number of upcoming
//! services to return, an optional direction for services and desired optional fields, such as
//! scheduled arrival time, expected arrival time, vehicle type (e.g. NGR, IMU etc. for trains),
//! with certain mandatory fields such as a route identifier.
//!
//! The communication protocol is defined within the gtfs-requests.proto file.
//!
//! Future work:
//!     - Extend request/response types to more than departure board information.
//!       Could easily extend to respond with fields such as location, as well as provide location
//!       tracking for connections and vehicle services, by receiving position reports from
//!       embedded devices and returning the closest services/services within x distance, allowing
//!       the embedded device to compute closest vehicle/vehicle most likely to be closest.
//!     - Extend the program to accept a real-time feed url and static database path to allow the
//!       server to process non-seq requests, which will be the default feed for development.
//!     - Add protobuf compilation to build.rs
