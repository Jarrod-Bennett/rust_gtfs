# Rust GTFS Projects
A collection of transit based projects built around the GTFS specification and written in Rust.

## Currently developing
- Replicating Translink departure boards, with an embedded departure board connected to server for processing.
- Closest vehicle detector, a device that uses real-time vehicle positions and GPS to identify which vehicle the user is
currently onboard, using machine learning with present and recent position data for accurate tracking.
